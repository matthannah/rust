// Rust has two different types of constants which can be declared in any scope
// including global. Both require explicit type annotation:

// 'const' An unchangable value
// 'static' A possibly mutable variable with 'static lifetime

// One special case is the string literal. It can be assigned directly to a static
// variable without modification because its type signature: &'static str has the
// required lifetime of 'static. All other reference types must be specifically
// annotated so that they fulfill the 'static lifetime. This may seem minor though
// because the required explicit annotation hides the distinction.

// Globals are declared outside all other scopes.
static LANGUAGE: &'static str = "Rust";
