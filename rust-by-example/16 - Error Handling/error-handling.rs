// Error handling is the process of handling the possibility of failure. For example, failing to
// read a file and then continuing to use that bad input would clearly be problematic. Noticing
// and explicitly managing those errors saves the rest of the program from various pitfalls.

// For a more rigorous discussion of error handling, refer to the error handling section in the
// official book.
